Project "Smart goal"
It is a tool which helps to help reach goals. 
You can write down goal, decompose it to several tasks (and sub-tasks), mark deadlines for each of them.
Tasks can have a priority and secerety, and connection to the other task (has to be done after, has to be done before, etc)
You can invite other person to work on task together. 
You can filter it: status - new, in progress, complete; persentage of completion; etc.
You can tune visibility of your goal.
Every goal has a criterias of completion.
